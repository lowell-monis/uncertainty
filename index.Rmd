It’s human nature to wonder how things are related.

We ask questions like:

+ Does more screen time affect how well students sleep?
+ Do heavier cars get worse fuel economy?
+ Do taller people tend to run faster?
+ Does the amount of training impact an athlete’s performance?
+ Do different bird species lay eggs of different sizes?

Whether in science, health, sports, or nature, we're wired to find patterns. And often, those patterns reveal themselves through relationships between variables.

Regression models help us formalize these relationships. They allow us to say, "when $x$ increases, how does $y$ change?" But every model we fit is just a best guess based on the data we have — and we know that data is often noisy, incomplete, or irregular.

This is where uncertainty enters the picture.

When we present a model without visualizing uncertainty, we’re giving a false sense of precision. That’s why concepts like confidence intervals, standard error, and significance are so important — they help communicate how sure we are about what we’re saying.

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:

1. Build and interpret a multiple regression model
2. Visually represent uncertainty and confidence intervals
3. Use accessible color palettes to support understanding for all viewers
4. Allow users to experiment with visual representations of certainty

By the end, you won’t just visualize better models, but more honest and interpretable ones.

# But first, what is regression?
